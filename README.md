# CUR-CX-MSI
Python codes for running CUR/CX decomposition on small to medium scale datasets with application in mass spectrometry imaging. 

## Codes
`src` contains codes for doing CUR/CX decomposition as well as parameter grid searching in Python.

`ipython_notebook` contains ipython notebooks for illustrating the usage and some of the results on MSI dataset.
